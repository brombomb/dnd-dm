   - (PRE/LE) We now home the DRAGON motors after DRAGON MULITBALL and TOWN

   - Changed the rules of Dragon Multiball:
           - The Higher level your character is, the harder it is to start
             Dragon Multiball. 
               - Low level - Any new target will give you a DRAGON letter.
               - Medium levels - You need to complete the 3 bank to get a
                 letter. At first any target will spot a target so its just hit
                 the 3-bank 3 times for one letter. Later you have to hit the
                 targets separately. 
               - At higher levels you need to complete the 3 bank all in one
                 ball to get a letter.
               - Also at higher levels the targets start to time out. So you
                 have to hit them before they time out.

           The higher level you are the higher level the dragon multiball will
           be when you start it.

           - The Dragon Letters now indicate how much life the dragon has left. 
             Meaning, if there are 4 letters blinking (DRAG__) then you need to
             hit the Dragon 4 more times to win.
           - Jackpots are now worth how many more drains before Rath wins times
             250K each. Meaning if you have 10 more drains left before you loose
             Jackpots are worth 2.5 million. The closer you are to loosing the
             less the value of the jackpots.
           - 1X Jackpots shots are yellow blinking triangles. Once you shoot
             them the lights will change to Orange for 2X and then change to 
             red for 3X Jackpots.
           - Shooting all the yellow arrows will light Super Jackpot.
           - Each Jackpot you collect will build the Super Jackpot Value.
           - How many Jackpots you collect during Dragon Multiball sets the
             value for how much jackpots are worth during Town Celebration. One
             Jackpot in Dragon Multiball equals 500K in Town Celebration.
             Meaning if you shot 10 jackpots in Dragon Multiball your Town
             Celebration jackpots will be worth 5M each.
           - Critical hit now awards a Jackpot shot and a hit to the dragon
             during Dragon Multiball.
           - Critical hit now awards a Jackpot during Town Celebration.

     from stacking up in the shooter lane especially during DRAGON MULTIBALL.
   - Improved the choreography on the transition between DRAGON MULTIBALL and
     TOWN CELEBRATION MULTIBALL.
   - PRISON BREAK now lights at least 1 shot for any hit to the SPINNER during
     that phase. Solid hits to the spinner will light 2 or more shots.
   - GELATINOUS CUBE MULTIBALL now starts its ball save timer once the actual
     multiball has started. Previously it would start for each ball
     locked/stuck on the CUBE magnet.
